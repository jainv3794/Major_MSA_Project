Hotel Room Booking Microservices Project
This repository hosts the codebase for a Hotel Room Booking microservices project, featuring a modular and scalable architecture. The system is composed of three main microservices: API Gateway, Booking Service, and Payment Service. These microservices collectively handle user bookings, room generation, and payment processing.
Project Structure
•	API Gateway (port 8080): Serves as the entry point for external requests, efficiently routing them to internal microservices.
•	Booking Service (port 8081): Manages user bookings, orchestrates room generation, and communicates with the Payment Service.
•	Payment Service (port 8083): Simulates payment transactions and returns a transactionId to the Booking Service.
